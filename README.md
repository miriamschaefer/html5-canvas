# HTML5 Canvas ðŸŽ¨ðŸ–Œ

Challenge part of [Javascript30]('https://javascript30.com/) course. This one was quite fun!

- Learned about the existance of `context`, which can be either 2D or 3D.
- Used for the first time the `innerWidth` and `innerHeight` properties in Javascript.
- Also got to use different methods I didn't know of such as `beginPath`, `lineTo` and `moveTo`.

I decided to add a reset button that reloads the browser, so the user can restart the canvas and draw again.
